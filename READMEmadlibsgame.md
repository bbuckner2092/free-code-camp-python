### Mad Libs Game ###

Summary:
A game where you can enter in random words and take all those words to be placed in a story randomly.

1. Produced 3 lines of code that will be made dynamic shortly.
2. Went through each line of code and inserted curly brackets for certain words that we wanted to replace.
3. We need to create 3 variables. The 1st variable is color which will have an input().
4. The 2nd variable is plural_noun which will also have an input().
5. The 3rd varialbe is celebrity which will alsoi have an input().
6. Once the variables have been created, we then went back into each line of print in order to replace the curly brackets with the variable names themselves. In addition, we added, removed, and/or relocated the double quotes to make sure that no variable name was inside of the string. Lastly, we have to make sure that we include the plus sign as well.
