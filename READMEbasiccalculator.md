## Basic Calculator ##

1. I created 2 variables, num1 and num2. With these variables, I included an input() for each so that way the individuals are able to insert two numbers (one for each variable.).
2. In running the basic calculator, I realized that it was not funcitoning properly. It was concatenating the two numbers together. (Side note: In order for us to run the mini-application we had to make sure we were in the terminal and not in python mode. It will not work that way.)
