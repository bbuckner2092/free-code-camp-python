# If Statements Notes

_Summary:_
-Helps our program to make decisions. 
- Allows the program to respond to the input that it is given.
- Programs are becoming a lot smarter. 
- If conditions are true, then we take a certain action. If those conditions are false then there will be a different action taken. 
- With these examples in this markdown, the if statements become more complex.
- If statements have to be reduced down to either a true or false evaluation.

## Text that will be used for the mapping out of the Python code.

## A Boolean Variable that is goign to store whether a user is a male or not

1. Created a varialbe (is_male) that was equal to True.
