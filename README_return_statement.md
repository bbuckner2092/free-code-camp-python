# Return Statement Information

_Summary:_
- Allow Python to return information from a function.

## Function that Cubes a Number
1. Define the cube definition: def cube():
2. For the parameter, write num
3. After the colon, write out the function that will be taking place: num*num*num
4. Be sure to use the return statement before the num*num*num or else the command line will return none.
_Note:_ We are able to create a variable to house the result of the cube function. We simply do the following:
- Write result = cube(4)
- inside of the print() insert the variable result.
- Result is not running the function but it is storing the result of the function. Since we have 4 as the number for the parameter when we use the print() it will show us 64.
