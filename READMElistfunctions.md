# List Functions Instructions #

**Summary:**
Using functions() with list in Python. Some of the most common and popular functions used on list to make them more easy and powerful to use.

1. **Extend():** Allows you to take a list and append another list to it. Example: **friends.extend(lucky_numbers)** The previous example will literally add the lucky numbers to the end of the friends list.
2. **append():** Allows you to append specific names/numbers NOT in a list to the list you are currently using.
3. **insert():** Takes two parameters, parameter 1 is where you want to insert the item and parameter 2 is where is the string/name that will be inserted into the numerical position that was specified in parameter 1.
4. **remove():**  We include the remove function to the friends variable. Be sure to put in double quotes the individual's name that you are wanting to exist now.
5. **clear():** Gives us an empty list. 
6. **po():** Removes the last element of the list.
7. **friends.index("string")::** The previous code allows for us to see where in the list a string/name is positioned at.
8. **friends.count("string"):** By using this code, we are able to retrieve the # of times a certain string is inside of a list. This is case sensitive.
