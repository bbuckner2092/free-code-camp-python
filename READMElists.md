Summary:
Lists can be used the same way as variables. The following are the steps to creating a lists:

1. Give the lists variable a name. Be sure to write down the variable name then = it to square brackets (we will write out the items of the list inside of the square brackets.)
2. We added the print() with the variable friends inside of it before hitting run to see the result.
3. **index strings from the list:** We can use [] followed by numerical values inside of the brackets in order to print out specific strings from a lists. 0 is actually the starting position for 1. _To index from the back of the list, you will begin with -1_.
4. **Index for several strings/names within a list:** By using a colon to serpate the numerical values inside of the square brackets, we are able to get the starting position. _Note: the second numerical value that we provide will NOT be included. It will get the string/name in the position before it._
5. **Updating names in a lists:** To complete this task, we would need to create a new variable with the same name as the list variabe, BUT we have to be sure that we use square brackets with the numberical value that coincides with the name position that we are after. Once we have grabbed that name, the next step is to = the new variable name to the new name which should be inside of double quotes. Example:_friends[1] = "John"_.
