# Functions

## Summary:
- A collection of code that performs a specific task.
- Helps you to organize your code better.
- A core concept for programming in python.

### Creating a function() taht says hi to a user.
1. Write def. (It will indicate that this person is wanting to use a function.)
2. Put a space after the word def.
3. write the name of the function. (In this case the function is sayhi).
4.Use parenthesis followed by a colon. 
5. To bring it all together it will look like the following: def sayhi():
6. The code that will go inside of a function, it will **HAVE** to be indented. Python indents 4 spaces exactly.
7. Once indented 4 spaces on the new line, we will write the following: print("Hello User")

### Call the Function After its Created

_Note:_ When we run the file wihtout calling the function, it will have no output. This is why we need to call it. The code inside of a function will only be executed when we specify that we want it to be executed.

1. Type out the name of the function with the open and closed parenthesis.
Example: sayhi(). 
_Note:_ Be sure to save the file prior to running it or else there will be no output.
