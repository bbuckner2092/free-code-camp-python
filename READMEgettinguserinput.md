# Working with User Inputs #

1. Getting accustomed to print(input). _As I run the print("Hello " + name + "!") it is not functioning as expected. I have to first run the name = input("Enter your name: ") THEN I am able to run the print. Unfortunately, it will not give me access to run the print to input a name._
2. Added "age" to the print function.
